## Project Description

The Stored Procedures for Pithia Database repository contains a collection of stored procedures developed for the Pithia database system. The purpose of these stored procedures is to enhance the functionality and performance of the database by providing pre-defined, optimized, and reusable routines for common database operations. 💡🗄️

The stored procedures are designed to improve data retrieval, modification, and management processes within the Pithia database. They offer a convenient way to perform complex queries, transactions, and other database operations while encapsulating the logic and ensuring consistent and efficient execution. 🔄✨

## Stored Procedures

The repository includes several stored procedures that serve specific purposes within the Pithia database. Some of the key stored procedures available are:

- `GetStudentCourses`: Retrieves the courses associated with a specific student.
- `EnrollStudent`: Enrolls a student in a course.
- `UpdateStudentGrade`: Updates the grade of a student in a specific course.
- `CalculateAverageGrade`: Calculates the average grade for a student.
- `DeleteStudent`: Deletes a student and related records from the database.

These stored procedures provide functionality to streamline common database operations and can be customized or extended as per the specific requirements of the Pithia database. 📄🧮

## Installation

To install and use the stored procedures for the Pithia Database, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/GeorgePanaretos/Stored_Procuders_Pithia_Database.git`
2. Connect to the Pithia database using an appropriate client or interface.
3. Execute the SQL script containing the stored procedures in the repository using the database client.
4. The stored procedures will be added to the database and can be accessed and used as required. 📥⚙️🗄️

## Usage

Once the stored procedures are installed in the Pithia database, you can utilize them in your database operations. Here are some examples of how to use the stored procedures:

1. Use the `GetStudentCourses` procedure to retrieve the courses associated with a specific student.
2. Utilize the `EnrollStudent` procedure to enroll a student in a course.
3. Update a student's grade in a specific course using the `UpdateStudentGrade` procedure.
4. Calculate the average grade for a student using the `CalculateAverageGrade` procedure.
5. Delete a student and related records from the database using the `DeleteStudent` procedure.

These examples showcase how the stored procedures can be called and integrated into your database workflows to streamline operations and improve efficiency. 📄🗄️🔢
